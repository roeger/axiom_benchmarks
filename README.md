### sokoban-axioms:
A formulation of the Sokoban domain using axioms. There are two
encodings originally provided: one uses only classical (STRIPS) PDDL and axioms, the
other uses "Functional STRIPS" (i.e., object-valued fluents, a la
PDDL 3.1). This repository contains only the classical PDDL version.

### psr-middle-noce:
The PSR middle-sized problem set from IPC 2004, formulation with
axioms but without conditional effects.

### mincut
>Consider an undirected graph, with a designated source node
>s and target node t. K “roadblocks” are located on the edges
>of the graph, and can move between adjacent edges. (More
>than one roadblock can occupy the same edge, and one can
>pass another on the edge.) The goal is to move the roadblocks
>so that there is no unblocked path from the source to the tar-
>get node. In other words, a goal state identifies an s-t-cut of
>size ≤ K. Hence, we call it the Min-Cut domain.

### social-planning
>Based loosely on "Planning-Based Narrative Generation in Simulated
>Game Universes" (IEEE Trans. on Computational Intelligence and AI
>in Games, 2009) and "Simulation-Based Story Generation with a Theory
>of Mind" (AIIDE 2008), both by Hsueh-Min Chang and Von-Wun Soo.

### trapping game
>As an example of a pseudo-adversarial domain with a more
>complex opponent strategy, we consider a game of two players,
>called the “blocker” and the “cat”. The cat moves from
>node to node on a graph (G), always moving to a node on
>a shortest unblocked path to one of a set of designated exit
>nodes. (To ensure deterministic moves, ties are broken by
>an arbitrary ordering of the nodes.) In between each move
>of the cat, the blocker can permanently block a node in the
>graph (though not the node the cat currently occupies). The
>cat wins if it reaches an exit, and the blocker wins if the cat is
>trapped (i.e., no longer able to reach an exit).

## Domains by Filipos Kominis and Hector Geffner (ICAPS 2015)
Problems by Filippos Kominis and Hector Geffner, from their paper
"Beliefs in Multiagent Planning: From One Agent to Many" (ICAPS 2015).
These are cooperative multi-agent planning with partial observability
and nested beliefs, compiled into planning with axioms. They were
sourced from (http://www.dtic.upf.edu/~fkominis/). The permission to redestribute was granted from the authors.

### collab-and-comm-kg
>As a third example, we consider a scenario where two agents
>volunteer information to each other in order to accomplish
>a task faster that would otherwise be possible without information
>exchange. It is inspired in the BW4T environment,
>a proposed testbed for joint activity (Johnson et al. 2009).
>There is a corridor of four rooms, p1, p2, p3 and p4 as in the
>previous example, four blocks b1, . . . , b4 that are in some
>of the rooms, and two agents a and b that can move back
>and forth along this corridor. Initially, the two agents are
>in p2 and do not know where the blocks are (they are not
>in p2). When an agent gets into a room, he can see which
>blocks are in the room if any. The goal of the planning problem
>is for agent a to know the position of block b1, and for
>agent b to know the position of block b2. A shortest plan
>for the problem involves six steps: one agent, say a, has to
>move to p1, the other agent has to move to p3, they both
>must sense which blocks are in these rooms, and then they
>must exchange the relevant information. At that point, the
>goal would be achieved whether or not the information exchanged
>explicitly conveys the location of the target blocks.
>Indeed, if agent a does not see block b1 in p1 and agent b
>doesn’t see this block either at p3, agent a will then know
>that block b1 must be in p4 once b conveys to a the relevant
>piece of information; in this case ¬Kbin(b1, p3).

### muddy-children-kg
A variation of muddy-child.

### muddy-child-kg

>MuddyChild(n, m) is a reformulation of MuddyChildren
>where a particular child must find out whether he is muddy
>or not. For this he can ask individually each other child i
>whether i knows that he is muddy, with all other children
>listening the response.
>>  Kominis and Geffner(ICAPS, 2015) 

### sum-kg

>Sum(n) is a domain based on ”What is the Sum?” (van Ditmarsch,
>van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007b), which in turn borrows
>from the ”Sum and Product Riddle” (van Ditmarsch,
>Ruan, and Verbrugge 2008) and the Muddy Children. There
>are three agents a, b, and c, each one with a number on his
>forehead between 1 and n. It is known that one of the numbers
>must be the sum of the other two. In addition, each agent
>can see the numbers on the other agent’s foreheads, and can
>>  Kominis and Geffner(ICAPS, 2015) 

### wordrooms

>WordRoom(m, n) is a variation of the collaboration through
>communication example. It involves two agents a and b that
>must find out a hidden word from a list of n possible words.
>The words can have at most 7 letters with the i-th letter of
>the word being in room ri , i = 1, . . . , 7. The two agents
>can move from a corridor to each of the rooms, and from
>any room back to the corridor. There is no direct connection
>among rooms, the two agents cannot be in the same room,
>and they both start in the corridor. The agents have sensors
>to find out the letter in a room provided that they are in
>the room, and they can communicate the truth of the literals
>Kxli where x is one of the two agents and li expresses that l
>is the i-th letter of the hidden word. The former amounts to
>14 sensing actions of the form sense(x, [li , l0 i , l00 i , . . .]) with
>the precondition that agent x is in room i, and where l, l 0
>, . . . are the different letters that may appear at position
>i of some of the n words. The parameter m in problem
>WordRoom(m, n) stands for the total number of li atoms.
>There are also 7 actions sense(a, [Kbli , Kbl 0 i , Kbl 00 i , . . .])
>where b communicates what he knows about room i to a,
>and similarly, 7 actions where a communicates to b. If we
>add the 14 actions for each agent moving from a room to the
>corridor and back, the total pool of actions is 56. The shortest
>plan for these problems is interesting when there is a lot
>of overlap among the n possible words, and in particular,
>when it may be more efficient for an agent to communicate
>not the letters that he has observed, but the letters that he can
>derive from what he knows.

("Automated Planning as an Early Verification Tool for Distributed
Control", Journal of Automated Reasoning vol. 54, 2015). The original problems can be found at (http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ernet.in/~pallab/PAPLAN.tar.gz). The repository contains the equivalent compiled problems by Ivankovic and Haslum(IJCAI, 2015): "cc1" is the compilatioin into STRIPS originally proposed by Ghosh et al (2015): "cc2" is the compilation into STRIPS with axioms.

### acc-cc1-ghosh-etal

>The ACC is designed to take away the burden of adjusting the speed of the vehicle from the driver, mostly
>under light traffic conditions. The ACC operates in two modes - the speed control mode and the time gap
>mode. In the speed control mode, the main functionality of ACC is to maintain the speed of the vehicle
>(termed ego vehicle) at a set constant speed v ref . In the time gap mode, the speed and distance of nearby
>vehicles (termed subject vehicles) are taken into consideration to maintain a safe time gap with the vehicles
>in the front. The time gap is defined as the time taken by a following vehicle to cover the distance from a
>leading vehicle at current speed. The speed control mode may be active when there is no obstructing traffic.
>The time gap mode may be active whenever obstructing traffic is detected by the vehicle’s radar.

### grid-cc1-ghosh-etal

>The GRID domain is a synthetic planning domain loosely based on cellular automata and
>incorporates a parallel depth first search protocol for added variety. A problem instance in
>this domain consists of a finite matrix of connected compute elements (processors) which
>process the jobs submitted to them (Fig. 7). Each processor in the grid has four communica-
>tion ports through which it may be connected to its neighboring processors. Jobs are created
>in a separate set of elements called as the dispenser units which are connected to some of
>the processors in the GRID via their communication ports. Once created, each new job is
>transferred to a processor (or rejected by the grid as a whole) after a distributed depth-first
>search occurs automatically for an available handler.

### psr-middle
>The task in PSR (power supply restoration) is to reconfigure a faulty power distribution
>network so as to resupply customers affected by the faults. The network consists of electric
>lines connected by switches and fed via a number of power sources that are equipped with circuitbreakers.
>When faults occur, the circuit-breakers of the sources feeding the faulty lines open to
>protect the network, leaving not only these lines but also many healthy ones un-supplied. The network
>needs to be reconfigured by opening and closing switches and circuit-breakers in such a way
>as to resupply the healthy portions. Unreliable fault sensors and switches lead to uncertainty about
>the state of the network. Furthermore, breakdown costs that depend on various parameters need to
>be optimized under constraints on the capacity of sources and lines. The application is a topic of ongoing
>interest in the field of power distribution, and has been investigated by the AI community for
>a long time, including from an AI planning standpoint (Thi´ebaux, Cordier, Jehl, & Krivine, 1996;
>Thi´ebaux & Cordier, 2001; Bertoli, Cimatti, Slaney, & Thi´ebaux, 2002; Bonet & Thi´ebaux, 2003).

>is the input language of the model checker SPIN (Holzmann, 2003). The language is loosely based
>on Dijkstra’s guarded command language, borrowing some notation from Hoare’s CSP language.
>One important property check is to detect deadlock states, where none of the processes can apply
>a transition. For example, a process may be blocked when trying to read data from an empty
>communication channel. Edelkamp (2003a) developed an automatic translation from Promela into
